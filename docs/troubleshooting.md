# Troubleshooting Network Recovery

This document provides solutions for common issues encountered during network recovery.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Interface Not Found

**Symptom:** `ip link show` doesn't display your network interface

**Solutions:**
- Check if drivers are loaded: `lspci -k | grep -A 3 Network`
- Load missing module: `sudo modprobe driver_name`
- Check if hardware is blocked: `rfkill list all`

### 2. WPA Authentication Failures

**Symptom:** Can't connect to WPA-protected network

**Solutions:**
- Verify password is correct
- Check wpa_supplicant configuration syntax
- Monitor connection attempt: `wpa_supplicant -d -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`

### 3. DHCP Issues

**Symptom:** No IP address assigned

**Solutions:**
- Try manual IP assignment
- Check DHCP server availability
- Verify network cable/signal strength
- Check logs: `journalctl -xe`

### 4. Package Installation Errors

**Symptom:** Can't install NetworkManager

**Solutions:**
- Update package cache
- Check repository sources
- Try offline package installation
- Verify disk space

### 5. DNS Resolution Problems

**Symptom:** Can't resolve domain names

**Solutions:**
- Check /etc/resolv.conf
- Try alternative DNS servers
- Verify network connectivity
- Check systemd-resolved status

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Network Diagnostics

```bash
# Check interface status
ip link show
ip addr show

# Monitor network traffic
tcpdump -i wlan0

# Check routing
ip route show
traceroute google.com
```

### System Logs

Important log files to check:
- `/var/log/syslog`
- `/var/log/dmesg`
- `/var/log/NetworkManager/`

### Hardware Issues

Steps to diagnose hardware problems:
1. Check physical connections
2. Verify hardware detection
3. Test with live USB
4. Check for firmware updates

## Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Network Access

1. Try wired connection
2. Use USB tethering
3. Transfer packages manually

### Scenario 2: Driver Issues

1. Identify required drivers
2. Download from another machine
3. Manual installation process

### Scenario 3: Configuration Corruption

1. Backup existing configs
2. Reset to defaults
3. Reconfigure step by step

## Prevention

- Regular backups of network configuration
- Document working settings
- Keep offline copies of essential packages
- Test changes in VM first
