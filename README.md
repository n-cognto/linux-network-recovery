# Restoring Network Connection After Deleting Network Manager

## Introduction

Accidentally deleting Network Manager on a Linux system can lead to loss of network connectivity, making it challenging to reinstall packages or access online resources. This guide provides a step-by-step process to manually reconnect to Wi-Fi (or Ethernet as a fallback) and reinstall Network Manager. It assumes a Debian-based system like Ubuntu but includes notes for other distributions for broader applicability.

### Prerequisites

- Root access (via `sudo`).
- A working wireless (or wired) interface; verify with `ip link show` (common names: `wlan0` for Wi-Fi, `eth0` for Ethernet; replace as needed).
- Wireless hardware drivers are intact (check with `lspci | grep -i network` or `lsusb` for USB adapters).
- If no network is available, consider offline methods like booting from a live USB or transferring packages via external storage.
- **Warning:** These manual steps are temporary; rebooting without reinstalling may reset configurations.

## Steps to Restore Connectivity

### 1. Bring Up the Network Interface

Ensure the interface is active:

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

- **Verification:** Run `ip link show wlan0` to confirm it's "UP".
- **Troubleshooting:** If blocked, use `rfkill unblock wifi`. For Ethernet fallback: `sudo ip link set eth0 up`.

### 2. Identify Available Wireless Networks

Scan for networks:

```bash
sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
```

(Modern alternative to deprecated `iwlist`; install `wireless-tools` if needed later.)

This displays SSIDs. If no results, ensure hardware is enabled and try rescanning.

### 3. Connect to a Wireless Network

#### For Open Networks:

```bash
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "your_ssid"
```

#### For Secured Networks (WPA/WPA2/WPA3):

Create a configuration file:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf <<EOF
network={
    ssid="your_ssid"
    psk="your_password"
}
EOF'
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Connect:

```bash
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

- **Verification:** Run `iwconfig wlan0` to check association.
- **Troubleshooting:** If authentication fails, verify password/SSID. For Ethernet: Skip to Step 4.

### 4. Obtain a Dynamic IP Address

Request an IP via DHCP:

```bash
sudo dhclient wlan0
```

- **Verification:** Run `ip addr show wlan0` to see assigned IP. Test with `ping 8.8.8.8`.
- **Troubleshooting:** If no DHCP response, add manual DNS:

  ```bash
  sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf'
  ```

  For static IP (rare): `sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev wlan0` and `sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1`.

#### Alternative Connectivity Methods

- **USB Tethering from Phone:** Enable on phone, then `sudo ip link set usb0 up && sudo dhclient usb0`.
- **Offline Package Transfer:** On another machine, download packages (e.g., `apt download network-manager`), transfer via USB, and install with `sudo dpkg -i *.deb`.

## Updating System Packages

With connectivity restored:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

For other distributions:

| Distribution  | Update Command                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`       |
| Fedora/RHEL   | `sudo dnf update -y`                           |
| Arch Linux    | `sudo pacman -Syu`                             |
| openSUSE      | `sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper update -y` |

- **Troubleshooting:** If mirrors fail, switch to a different one in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

## Reinstalling Network Manager

Install core packages:

```bash
sudo apt install -y network-manager network-manager-gnome wpasupplicant wireless-tools ifupdown
```

This reinstalls:

- `network-manager`: Core network management.
- `network-manager-gnome`: GUI tools (optional for servers; skip with `--no-install-recommends`).
- `wpasupplicant`: WPA authentication.
- `wireless-tools`: Wireless utilities (deprecated but useful).
- `ifupdown`: Interface control.

For other distributions, adapt the command (e.g., `sudo dnf install -y NetworkManager ...` for Fedora).

- **Offline Reinstallation (Advanced):** Boot from live USB, mount root (`sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`), chroot (`sudo chroot /mnt`), then run install commands using cached packages.

### Post-Reinstall Verification

- Run `nmcli device wifi list` to scan via Network Manager CLI.
- For GUI: Restart the service with `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`.

---

## Reboot the System

Apply changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, Network Manager should manage connections automatically.

---

## Prevention and Best Practices

- Prevent accidental removal: `sudo apt-mark hold network-manager`.
- Backup configs: `cp -r /etc/NetworkManager ~/nm-backup`.
- Alternatives: Consider `systemd-networkd` for lightweight setups:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd systemd-resolved
  ```
- Test in a VM: Simulate deletion in VirtualBox to practice.

## Additional Networking Tools

For ongoing troubleshooting:

- Install `net-tools` (`sudo apt install net-tools`) for `ifconfig`, `netstat`.
- Use `nmap` for scanning: `sudo apt install nmap && nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`.
- Monitor with `wireshark`: `sudo apt install wireshark`.
